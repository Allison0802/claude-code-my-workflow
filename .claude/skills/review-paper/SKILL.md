# Manuscript Review

Produce a thorough, constructive review of an academic manuscript — the kind of report a top-journal referee would write.

**Input:** `$ARGUMENTS` — path to a paper (.tex, .pdf, or .qmd), or a filename in `master_supporting_docs/`.

---

## Steps

1. **Locate and read the manuscript.** Check:
   - Direct path from `$ARGUMENTS`
   - `master_supporting_docs/supporting_papers/$ARGUMENTS`
   - Glob for partial matches

2. **Read the full paper** end-to-end. For long PDFs, read in chunks (5 pages at a time).

3. **Evaluate across 6 dimensions** (see below).

4. **Generate 3-5 "referee objections"** — the tough questions a top referee would ask.

5. **Produce the review report.**

6. **Save to** `quality_reports/paper_review_[sanitized_name].md`

## Review Dimensions

### 1. Argument Structure
- Is the research question clearly stated?
- Does the introduction motivate the question effectively?
- Is the logical flow sound (question → method → results → conclusion)?
- Are the conclusions supported by the evidence?
- Are limitations acknowledged?

### 2. Statistical Methodology
- Is the statistical model appropriate for the data structure (recurrent events, competing risks, censoring)?
- Are the key modeling assumptions stated explicitly and justified?
- Are there threats to validity (informative censoring, model misspecification, violation of independence)?
- Are robustness checks or sensitivity analyses adequate?
- Is the estimator appropriate for the estimand of interest?

### 3. Estimation Approach
- Correct variance estimation (sandwich estimator, bootstrap, or analytical)?
- Appropriate baseline hazard or cumulative incidence specification?
- Sample size and power adequate for the claimed precision?
- Multiple testing or selection concerns when comparing many methods?
- Are performance metrics (C-index, Brier score, IPA) interpreted correctly?

### 4. Literature Positioning
- Are the key papers cited?
- Is prior work characterized accurately?
- Is the contribution clearly differentiated from existing work?
- Any missing citations that a referee would flag?

### 5. Writing Quality
- Clarity and concision
- Academic tone
- Consistent notation throughout
- Abstract effectively summarizes the paper
- Tables and figures are self-contained (clear labels, notes, sources)

### 6. Presentation
- Are tables and figures well-designed?
- Is notation consistent throughout?
- Are there any typos, grammatical errors, or formatting issues?
- Is the paper the right length for the contribution?

## Principles

- **Be constructive.** Every criticism should come with a suggestion.
- **Be specific.** Reference exact sections, equations, tables.
- **Think like a referee at a top-5 journal.** What would make them reject?
- **Distinguish fatal flaws from minor issues.** Not everything is equally important.
- **Acknowledge what's done well.** Good research deserves recognition.
- **Do NOT fabricate details.** If you can't read a section clearly, say so.
