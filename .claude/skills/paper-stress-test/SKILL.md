# Paper Stress-Test

Adversarial single-paper interrogation: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Overview

This skill uploads a paper to a disposable NotebookLM notebook, then runs a structured adversarial debate across nine lenses weighted by detected paper type. Each round of each lens spawns a fresh Opus Reviewer (hostile Biostatistics referee) and a fresh Sonnet Author-surrogate (defends the paper using only paper-internal evidence retrieved via NotebookLM); the Moderator holds the running transcript and writes a read-reasoning-and-decision entry after every (Reviewer, Author) exchange, which steers the next round. A concurrent sub-call to the `novelty-check` skill provides external novelty verification. The output is a structured briefing with per-lens severity, top-5 killer questions, sub-project relevance, and a cite/build-on/flag/skip recommendation.

Spec reference: `quality_reports/specs/2026-04-22_paper-stress-test-design.md`.

## Workflow

Seven phases (0–6):

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | Input resolution + prior-test detection + output dir setup |
| 1 | NotebookLM setup (disposable notebook + paper upload + thematic resolution) |
| 2 | Paper-type detection (one-shot Reviewer classification spawn), novelty-check sub-call, plan confirmation |
| 3 | Per-lens adversarial debate — fresh Reviewer + Author spawns per round, with Moderator read-reasoning-decision entries between rounds (Lens 7 triangulates three sources) |
| 4 | Synthesis (top-5 questions, sub-project relevance, recommendation) |
| 5 | Write briefing + transcripts + state files |
| 6 | Cleanup with optional promote-to-thematic |

## Constants

- DISPOSABLE_NOTEBOOK_NAME_PREFIX = `stress-test-`
- COMPACTION_THRESHOLD_CHARS = 80000
- NOVELTY_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 300
- REVIEWER_MODEL = `claude-opus-4-7`
- AUTHOR_MODEL = `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- OUTPUT_DIR = `master_supporting_docs/supporting_papers/stress_tests`

## Parsing contract

All parsing of subagent output (Reviewer, Author, classification-triple, novelty-check runner) MUST use the regexes in this section. If a response does not match the canonical pattern, the calling task executes the "Reparse protocol" below once; if still no match, the calling task follows its task-specific recovery (recorded `errored`, user-prompted override, etc.).

### Reparse protocol

On first parse failure, reprompt the source subagent with a format reminder (verbatim from the persona file, quoted). Capture the second response. If the second response still fails, do NOT reprompt again — hand off to the task-specific recovery.

The reprompt message template:

```
Your previous response did not match the required format. The format is:

<copy the relevant format block from the persona verbatim>

Return ONLY a response in that format, nothing else.
```

### Patterns

All regexes below are POSIX-extended, multiline, case-sensitive unless noted. Matches may span newlines where `(?s)` is applied. Whitespace around field values must be trimmed on capture.

#### 1. Reviewer primary-question turn

```
^QUESTION:[[:space:]]*(.+?)(?=\n[A-Z_]+:|\z)
```
Captures one group: the question text (may span multiple lines, stops at next `FIELD:` line or end of string).

#### 2. Reviewer judgment + decision turn

Five fields, each on its own line; fields 4 and 5 are mutually exclusive based on field 3's value.

```
^JUDGMENT:[[:space:]]*(cited|evaded|handwaved|conceded)[[:space:]]*$
^REASONING:[[:space:]]*(.+?)(?=\n[A-Z_]+:|\z)
^NEXT:[[:space:]]*(FOLLOWUP|FINAL)[[:space:]]*$
^FOLLOWUP:[[:space:]]*(.+?)(?=\n[A-Z_]+:|\z)     # only required if NEXT=FOLLOWUP
^SEVERITY:[[:space:]]*(critical|major|minor|clean)[[:space:]]*$  # only required if NEXT=FINAL
```

Validation: JUDGMENT must match the enum exactly. REASONING must be non-empty. If NEXT=FOLLOWUP, FOLLOWUP must be non-empty. If NEXT=FINAL, SEVERITY must match the enum exactly.

#### 3. Reviewer Lens 7 initial turn

```
^QUESTION:[[:space:]]*(.+?)(?=\nTHEMATIC_QUERY:)
^THEMATIC_QUERY:[[:space:]]*(.+?)(?=\n[A-Z_]+:|\z)
```

Both fields required and non-empty.

#### 4. Reviewer Lens 7 confrontation turn

Either the confrontation path:

```
^CONFRONTATION:[[:space:]]*(.+?)(?=\n[A-Z_]+:|\z)
```

Or the early-close path:

```
^JUDGMENT:[[:space:]]*cited[[:space:]]*$
^SEVERITY:[[:space:]]*clean[[:space:]]*$
```

Validator checks for presence of EITHER `CONFRONTATION:` OR (`JUDGMENT: cited` AND `SEVERITY: clean`). If both or neither appear, reparse.

#### 5. Author answer turn

```
^ANSWER:[[:space:]]*(.+?)(?=\nCITATIONS:)
^CITATIONS:[[:space:]]*(.*)\z
```

The citation block is either:
- `CITATIONS: none` → `citations = []`
- one or more lines starting with `- ` under the CITATIONS header → `citations = [line.lstrip('- ') for line in lines]`

Validation: ANSWER must be non-empty. If ANSWER starts with the literal phrase `the paper does not address this`, the lens's `evidence` field is set to `"absent"` regardless of what follows in CITATIONS.

#### 6. Classification triple-query response

The Reviewer returns three concatenated paragraphs with heading markers. Three fields to extract:

```
detected_type:   ^(?:##|\*\*)\s*Classification\s*(?:\*\*)?\s*\n\s*([a-z][a-zA-Z-]+)\b
headline_claim:  ^(?:##|\*\*)\s*Headline contribution\s*(?:\*\*)?\s*\n\s*"?([^"\n]+)"?
novelty_claims:  ^(?:##|\*\*)\s*Novelty claims\s*(?:\*\*)?\s*\n((?:\s*\d+\.\s+.+\n?)+)
```

Note: the heading regex accepts BOTH `## Classification` AND `**Classification**` to tolerate persona format drift.

`detected_type` capture must match the 5-value enum; see Step 2.4 for validation flow.

`novelty_claims` capture is a numbered-list block; split on `\n\s*\d+\.\s+` to get individual items.

#### 7. novelty-check report

The `novelty-check` skill's Phase D output. Regexes:

```
overall_score:      Score:[[:space:]]*(\d+)/10
recommendation:     Recommendation:[[:space:]]*(PROCEED WITH CAUTION|PROCEED|ABANDON)
key_differentiator: Key differentiator:[[:space:]]*(.+?)(?=\n-|\n##|\z)
closest_prior_work: Closest Prior Work[[:space:]]*\n(\|.+\|\n)+
```

For `closest_prior_work`, split each table row on `|` (strip pipes and whitespace), skip the header row and separator row, build a `{paper, year, venue, overlap, key_difference}` object per remaining row.

If any field fails to parse, leave it `null`. Do NOT fail the whole run — the raw report is kept in `raw_report_md` regardless.

### Cross-reference (updated 2026-04-22 evening for the transcript-relay Phase 3 step numbering)

| Pattern | Used in tasks |
|---------|---------------|
| 1. Primary question (Format A) | T8 Step 3.5 (round 1 of any non-Lens-7 lens) |
| 2. Judgment + decision (Format B) | T8 Step 3.5 (rounds 2..depth and any `close_lens_mode` turn), T9 Step 3.6 (terminal Reviewer, round 3), T11 Step 3.8 (severity extraction) |
| 3. Lens 7 initial (Format C — QUESTION + THEMATIC_QUERY) | T9 Step 3.6 (round 1) |
| 4. Lens 7 confrontation (Format C — CONFRONTATION or JUDGMENT+SEVERITY) | T9 Step 3.6 (round 2) |
| 5. Author answer (ANSWER + CITATIONS) | T8 Step 3.5 (every Author turn), T9 Step 3.6 (rounds 1 and 2 Author turns) |
| 6. Classification triple | T4 Step 2.3 |
| 7. novelty-check | T5 Step 2.6 |

## Defer-tool preamble

Before Phase 0, the Moderator must load two deferred tools via ToolSearch:

```
ToolSearch(query="select:Agent,TodoWrite", max_results=2)
```

These are required: `Agent` spawns fresh Reviewer and Author subagents synchronously at every round of every lens (no `SendMessage` continuity is used — see §Architecture Amendment); `TodoWrite` tracks lens progress.
